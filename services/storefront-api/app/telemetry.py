"""Every Prometheus instrument the storefront owns.

Grouped the way Part B asks for them: application metrics describe the service,
business metrics describe the shop. All four Prometheus types appear across the
two groups (Counter, Gauge, Histogram, Summary).

Label discipline: every label below has a small, bounded set of values
(route templates, HTTP status, a fixed reason enum, five SKUs). Nothing
unbounded — no order id, no customer, no request id. See `DEMO_REQUESTS` at the
bottom for the deliberate counter-example used in the Part E experiment.
